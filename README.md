# Optical-motion
Optical Flow-- Lucas-Kanade method
#Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects
#between two consecutive frames caused by the movemement 
#of object or camera.

#Optical flow works on several assumptions:

#The pixel intensities of an object do not change b/w consecutive frames.
#Neighbouring pixels have similar motion.
